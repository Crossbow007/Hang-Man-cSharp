This C# Hangman game allows users to input their name and other information. Afterward, users can attempt to guess a word. If the guess is correct, one of the placeholders ("-") will disappear. In case of an incorrect guess, a message prompts the user to try again, and the hangman picture progresses. As users continue to guess, the hangman picture changes accordingly. If users run out of attempts, the hangman is unfortunately "killed."
